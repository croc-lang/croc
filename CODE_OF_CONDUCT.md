# Code of Conduct

## Guidelines

The Croc community is committed to creating a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all members, regardless of their experience, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality or other similar characteristics.

In return, we ask you to:

- Be welcoming and patient with other members,
- Be considerate and friendly,
- Be careful about the words you use,
- Seek to understand disagreements and recognise when progress is blocked,
- Respect other members of the community.

This list is not exhaustive and should be seen as a guide to facilitate communication and participation in the community.

The code of conduct applies to all areas managed by Croc, such as chat systems, forums, issue tracking systems, events, and any other space the community uses to communicate. It also applies to all communications and conduct in these spaces, including emails, chats, presentations, videos, posters, signs and the like.

Remarks that violate the standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive or exclusionary remarks, are not tolerated. Swearing is allowed, but it should never be directed at another member and should never be expressed in a hateful manner. Moderators may deem remarks that are not in the code of conduct to be inappropriate, and these will also be banned.

The moderators will first warn members who break the rules of conduct. If the warning is not heeded, the user will be banned, i.e. expelled from the communication channel until they calm down.

We ask you to limit unstructured criticism and to create a fork to test your ideas. Any insulting, degrading or harassing behaviour towards a member is unacceptable. We interpret the term "harassment" as defined in the Citizen's Code of Conduct. If you are in any doubt about what may be included in this definition, please consult it. We do not tolerate behaviour that excludes people from socially marginalised groups. Private harassment is also unacceptable.

If you experience or witness harassment, please contact one of the channel managers or moderation team members immediately. Whether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer, we are here to help you and make this community a safe place for everyone.

Finally, spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or any other attention-seeking behaviour is not allowed.

## Reporting conduct

Currently, it is not possible to report misbehaviour, this is temporary while a community develops.

# Croc

Croc is an experimental equivalent of the C and Rust programming languages for producing efficient and powerful programs.
It is designed to reduce common memory errors in C, such as accidental memory leaks, use after release and many others.
Croc aims to allow free memory allocation and release management with auto-free at compile time.
